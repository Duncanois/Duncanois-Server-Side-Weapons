Inspired by LittleRedSonja T2 Evolved Into T3 Grade Weapons (https://7daystodiemods.com/littleredsonja-t2-evolved-into-t3-grade-weapons/), I see she has not updated it since November 18 2024. I really enjoyed this mod, so I decided to make my own.

For now there is only one weapon, the FLA Battle Rifle (an upgraded variant of the Tactical AR), which features a higher damage (93.6 T6) compared to the M60 (83.6 T6), but a slower rate of fire (360) and a smaller default magazine size (20).
